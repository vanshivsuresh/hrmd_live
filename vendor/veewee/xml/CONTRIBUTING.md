# Contributing

VeeWee/XML is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute,
feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

## Branching strategy

- __Always__ base your changes on the `master` branch (all new development happens here),
- When you create Pull Request, always select `master` branch as target, otherwise it
will be closed (this is selected by default).

## Coverage

- All classes and functions that are added to the project .should be covered by Tests.
- All classes and functions need to be documented

## Code style / Formatting

- All code in the `src` folder must follow the PSR-2 standard that is enforced by code styling tools.
